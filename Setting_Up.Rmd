title: "Setting Up For MIGseq"

This notebook will document the installations and other steps I used to set up both Treebeard and Khaleesi (plus my work computer for some cases) to analyze MIGseq data (Suyama et al. 2015).

# Install Stacks
```{unix}
#downloaded with curl from http://catchenlab.life.illinois.edu/stacks/source/stacks-2.4.tar.gz

tar xfvz stacks-2.4.tar.gz

# Based on running ./configure, Neither Khaleesi nor Treebeard have a high enough version of gcc. However, I figured out that they do, if you:

scl enable devtoolset-8 bash
gcc --version

#gcc (GCC) 8.2.1 20180905 (Red Hat 8.2.1-3)

./configure #worked!

make -j 8 # use 8 threads to make

sudo make install # it all totally worked!

```
